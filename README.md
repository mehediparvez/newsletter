4. **Google Apps Script**: Scripts for data synchronization and newsletter generation (Fourth and Fifth Steps)
5. **HubSpot API**: Email delivery with personalization.

### Low-Level Design

#### 1. Data Structure

**Member Portfolio Sheet**
```
| Member ID | Assets   | Associate | Notes | Interests |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| email     | SOL      |           |       | AI        |
|           | ETH      |           |       | Memecoins |
```

**Research Updates Sheet** (Second Step: Research Sheet Access)
```
| Assets | Default Message                        | Oct 13 | Oct 20 | Oct 27    | Nov 3 |
|--------|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| BTC    | Nothing new to report, see YSL Hub... | -      | -      | BTC ETFs... | -     |
| ETH    | Nothing new to report, see YSL Hub... | -      | -      | -         | -     |
| Pendle | Nothing new to report, see YSL Hub... | -      | Pendle... | -         | -     |
```

**Master Portfolio Sheet** (created by sync script)
```
| MemberID           | BTC | ETH | SOL | USDC | DOGE | ... | LastSynced          | SourceSheetURL          |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-----|---------------------|------------------------|
| john@example.com  | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    | 1    | ... | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | https://docs.google... |
| sarah@example.com | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1    | 0    | ... | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | https://docs.google... |
```

This structure is efficient because:
1. There are a finite number of cryptocurrencies
2. Each member needs only one row for storing assets data
3. Reduces data redundancy and improves lookup efficiency
4. Minimizes concurrency conflicts during simultaneous updates

#### 2. Synchronization Process

**A. Initial Setup**:

1. Create a Master Portfolio Sheet to aggregate all member portfolio data
2. Create a "Member Registry" tab within the Master Sheet to track all member sheets
3. Write an Apps Script project attached to the Master Portfolio Sheet to manage all synchronization
4. Configure the Apps Script to read all member sheets from the registry and populate the master sheet
5. Set up a system for registering new member sheets and adding them to the registry

**B. Member Sheet Registry**:

The Member Registry tab in the Master Sheet keeps track of all individual member sheets with enhanced metadata for scalability:

```
| SheetID        | MemberEmail       | SheetName  | LastSynced          | SyncStatus | CreatedDate         | ModifiedDate        | Priority |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 1Abc...XYZ    | john@example.com  | Portfolio  | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | SUCCESS    | 2025-10-01T10:00:00 | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | 1        |
| 2Def...123    | sarah@example.com | Portfolio  | 2025-10-15T14:35:00 | SUCCESS    | 2025-10-05T11:30:00 | 2025-10-15T14:35:00 | 2        |
```

This enhanced registry enables:
- Dynamic discovery of all member sheets without hardcoding IDs
- Tracking sync status for each member sheet
- Timestamp-based incremental processing for scalability
- Prioritization of syncs based on modification time or importance
- Adding new member sheets without modifying code
- Admin interface for managing member sheets and troubleshooting

**C. Apps Script Project Structure**:

The synchronization logic resides in a single Apps Script project that is bound to the Master Portfolio Sheet:

1. **Central Management**: All code is maintained in one place for easier updates and maintenance
2. **Permission Model**: The script runs with the permissions of the Master Portfolio Sheet owner
3. **Member Sheet Registry**: A separate sheet tab in the Master Sheet tracks all member sheets
4. **Dynamic Sheet Access**: No hardcoding of sheet IDs - all member sheets are discovered and tracked in the registry
5. **Cross-Sheet Access**: The script has read access to member sheets and read/write access to the Master Sheet

**D. Research Sheet Access Implementation**:

This component implements the **Second Step: Research Sheet Access** from the workflow diagram, providing the research content that will be matched with member portfolios.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Research Data Structure**:
   - Maintain a consistent columnar format with assets in rows and dates in columns
   - Include default messages for assets with no updates in a given week
   - Support rich text formatting for complex content

2. **Access Pattern**:
   - Direct sheet access using Google Sheets API via Apps Script
   - Scheduled weekly retrieval timed with research team updates
   - Read-only operations to prevent accidental modifications
   - Versioning support to track content changes over time

3. **Optimization Strategy**:
   - Cache research data during newsletter generation cycles
   - Implement change detection to process only updated content
   - Use batch retrieval to minimize API calls
   - Apply column filtering to retrieve only relevant date ranges

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- Requires consistent formatting discipline from research team
- Content size limitations per cell (~50,000 characters)
- Potential performance impact with very large research datasets
- Manual intervention needed for special formatting or attachments
- Weekly synchronization window dependent on research team schedule

**E. Member Sheet Registration - Optimized Folder Monitor Approach**:

The system uses a highly optimized folder monitoring approach specifically for collecting new member spreadsheets. This approach implements the **First Step: Customer Portfolio Sheet Access** in the workflow diagram, focusing on efficient discovery and registration of member sheets.

**Folder Scanning Implementation for New Member Collection:**
1. **Dedicated Member Folder Structure**: 
   - Establish a centralized Google Drive folder specifically for member spreadsheets
   - Structure with optional subfolder organization (e.g., by account manager or joining date)
   - Apply proper permission model for secure access control
   - Set up monitoring process focused on this specific folder structure

2. **New Member Discovery Process**:
   - Implement scheduled scans to identify newly added spreadsheets
   - Use Drive API search queries with specific MIME type filtering for spreadsheets
   - Apply server-side sorting by creation date to prioritize newest members
   - Compare against registry to identify truly new additions

3. **Metadata-Based Processing**:
   - Use file metadata (creation date, last modified date) to identify new members
   - Extract owner and sharing information for permission validation
   - Inspect sheet properties to confirm it's a valid member portfolio
   - Prioritize processing based on creation recency

**Change Detection Approaches Comparison**:

**Approach 1: Individual Sheet Edit Triggers**
- **Implementation**: Install Apps Script triggers on each member sheet that fire on edit events
- **Pros**:
  - Real-time updates as changes occur
  - Minimal processing overhead for unchanged sheets
  - Direct access to exact cells that were modified
  - Can access full context of the edit (user, timestamp, range)
- **Cons**:
  - Requires installing triggers on every sheet (setup complexity)
  - Each member sheet needs custom code or permissions
  - Limited by Apps Script quotas for simultaneous triggers
  - May miss changes if trigger installation fails

**Approach 2: Folder Metadata Monitoring**
- **Implementation**: Periodically scan the member folder to detect modified files via metadata
- **Pros**:
  - Centralized code and permissions in one script
  - No need to modify individual member sheets
  - Works with any sheet regardless of structure or permissions
  - Can detect sheet deletions/moves/renames
- **Cons**:
  - Not real-time (depends on scanning interval)
  - Higher overhead as all files must be checked
  - Requires additional API calls to fetch actual sheet content
  - Can't detect which specific cells changed without comparing versions

**Recommended Approach**: A hybrid solution is optimal for most scenarios:
- **Folder monitoring** for new member sheet discovery and batch processing
- **Edit triggers** for existing high-priority members requiring real-time updates
- **Metadata scanning** as a fallback to ensure no changes are missed

For the current scenario with up to 1,000 members, folder metadata monitoring is recommended as the primary approach due to:
- Simplified management with centralized code
- Better scalability as the number of sheets grows
- More reliable detection of all types of changes
- Less dependency on individual sheet configurations

**Optimizations:**
- Store last scan timestamps to enable efficient incremental processing
- Track sheet metadata (creation/modification dates) to identify only changed files
- Implement caching to avoid redundant Google Drive API calls
- Apply server-side filtering and sorting via Drive API query parameters
- Use registry-based approach to avoid re-processing already registered sheets

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- Google Apps Script's 6-minute execution timeout requires careful batching
- Drive API has rate limits that necessitate controlled processing speeds
- Each file access requires a separate API call, which can be expensive at scale
- Large member folders (approaching 1,000) will need multiple scan batches
- Manual intervention may be required for persistent processing errors
```

**E. Multi-Approach Sync Strategy**:

This component implements the **Third Step: Sync Portfolio Data** in the workflow diagram, with an enhanced focus on comparing approaches for tracking changes in member spreadsheets that contain multiple sheets, where one specific sheet contains the asset data.

**Approach 1: Trigger-Based Change Detection**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Selective Sheet Trigger Installation**: 
   - Install edit triggers specifically on the asset data sheet within each member spreadsheet
   - Configure trigger to monitor only relevant ranges containing portfolio data
   - Execute synchronization only when changes occur in asset-related cells

2. **Targeted Data Extraction Process**:
   - Access the exact sheet containing asset information
   - Extract only modified portfolio data using event object information
   - Apply change detection to identify specifically which assets were modified
   - Transform data into the standardized format for the Master Sheet

3. **Real-Time Update Benefits**:
   - Immediate synchronization when changes occur
   - Direct access to edit event context (user, timestamp, modified range)
   - Fine-grained control over which changes trigger updates
   - Ability to implement validation at the point of change

**Optimizations:**
- Use edit event ranges to process only changed areas
- Apply debouncing to handle rapid successive edits
- Implement change significance detection to filter minor edits
- Cache previous state to compute precise differences

**Limitations:**
- Requires managing triggers across hundreds of spreadsheets
- Each member spreadsheet needs appropriate script permissions
- Complex to maintain consistent trigger behavior across all sheets
- Higher risk of hitting Apps Script quotas with many simultaneous edits
- Limited visibility into external changes (e.g., API modifications)

**Approach 2: Metadata-Based Change Detection**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Centralized Monitoring Logic**: 
   - Scan the members folder on a scheduled basis (e.g., every 5-15 minutes)
   - Use Drive API to fetch metadata for all spreadsheets in the folder
   - Compare modification timestamps against registry records
   - Identify spreadsheets with potential changes since last scan

2. **Selective Content Retrieval**:
   - Open only potentially modified spreadsheets identified from metadata
   - Navigate directly to the specific sheet containing asset data
   - Compare content with previously stored state or checksums
   - Process only sheets with confirmed changes to assets

3. **Batch Processing Advantages**:
   - Consolidated processing reduces overall API usage
   - Centralized code base with simpler maintenance
   - Unified permission model with admin-level access
   - Ability to implement prioritization for important members
   - Built-in retry mechanism for temporarily inaccessible sheets

**Optimizations:**
- Use modification timestamps to process only recently changed sheets
- Implement content hashing to quickly detect actual data changes
- Apply intelligent batching based on file change frequency patterns
- Leverage server-side filtering to reduce API calls

**Limitations:**
- Not real-time (delay based on scanning frequency)
- Higher overhead for initial metadata retrieval
- Cannot determine exact cells changed without content comparison
- Requires additional processing to identify which sheets changed within each spreadsheet

**Recommended Hybrid Implementation:**

For this specific use case with multi-sheet member spreadsheets, we recommend a hybrid approach:

1. **Primary: Metadata-Based Monitoring**
   - Schedule frequent scans (every 5-15 minutes) of the members folder
   - Use Drive API's efficient metadata queries to identify potentially changed spreadsheets
   - Process only spreadsheets modified since the last scan

2. **Secondary: Selective Trigger Application**
   - Install edit triggers only on high-priority member spreadsheets
   - Configure triggers to monitor specifically the asset data sheet
   - Use trigger-based approach as a complement for time-sensitive updates

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Maintain a unified sync queue for both approaches
   - Apply deduplication to prevent redundant processing
   - Implement priority-based processing for the queue

This hybrid approach provides the scalability benefits of metadata scanning while allowing real-time updates for critical members, offering the best balance between performance, reliability, and resource usage when managing up to 1,000 member spreadsheets.

#### 3. Newsletter Generation Process

This process covers the **Fourth Step: Match Data** and **Fifth Step: Generate Personalized Content** in the workflow diagram, where Customer Portfolio data is matched with Research Updates to generate personalized newsletters.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Simple Data Matching**:
   - For each member, identify which assets in their portfolio have relevant research updates
   - Prepare only the necessary data for their personalized newsletter

2. **Using HubSpot API**:
   - Use pre-configured email templates set up in HubSpot
   - Send only the dynamic content (matched research updates) to populate these templates
   - Leverage HubSpot's template system for consistent formatting and design

3. **Processing Efficiency**:
   - Process members in manageable batches to avoid timeout issues
   - Use simple caching to improve performance
```

#### 4. HubSpot Integration

This component implements the **Sixth Step: Send to HubSpot** in the workflow diagram, delivering personalized newsletters to members through the HubSpot email API.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Simple API Integration**:
   - Use HubSpot's Single Send API to deliver personalized emails
   - Authenticate using API key for secure access
   - Utilize pre-configured email templates in HubSpot

2. **Delivery Process**:
   - Generate personalized email content based on member's portfolio matches
   - Send content and recipient information directly to HubSpot API
   - Track delivery status for monitoring purposes

**Considerations:**
- Batch processing to respect HubSpot's rate limits (10 requests/second)
- Pre-defined templates will be used to ensure consistent formatting
- HubSpot will handle unsubscribe management and email compliance
- Simple retry mechanism for failed deliveries
```

#### 5. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

This component handles the **Failure Handling** aspects shown as "Pass" or "Fail" decision points throughout the workflow diagram, ensuring reliable operation and recovery from errors at each step.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Implement structured logging for all operations
   - Record detailed information about successes and failures
   - Maintain dedicated log sheets for each system component

   - Deploy for production use with monitoring system

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Google Apps Script Execution Limits**:
   - 6-minute timeout per execution
   - Need for batch processing (50-100 members per batch)
   - Daily quota limits on API calls

2. **Synchronization Challenges**:
   - Ensuring all member sheet changes are captured
   - Handling conflicts or corrupted data
   - Concurrent update management (see Concurrency Handling section below)

3. **Email Delivery**:
   - HubSpot Single Send API rate limits
   - Monitoring email deliverability

4. **Data Structure Considerations**:
   - The column-based Master Sheet structure significantly improves efficiency
   - Limited by the total number of cryptocurrencies (finite set of ~30-100 assets)
   - Each member requires only a single row regardless of portfolio size
   - Minimizes Google Sheets' 5 million cell limit impact
   - Column-based structure allows atomic updates to a single member row, reducing concurrent update conflicts

### Concurrency Handling

A critical challenge in the short-term solution is handling concurrent updates to the Master Portfolio Sheet, especially relevant to the interconnected flows in the client's diagram where multiple processes must coordinate.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple Apps Script triggers attempting to update the Master Sheet simultaneously
- **Data Corruption**: One update might overwrite another's changes
- **Quota Exhaustion**: Many simultaneous executions could quickly hit Google Apps Script quotas
- **Timeout Failures**: Complex updates might exceed the 6-minute execution limit

#### Recommended Approach:

1. **Implement a Queue System**:

   **Implementation Approach:**
   - Create a dedicated SyncQueue sheet to track pending updates
   - Record sheet ID, member email, timestamp, and status for each update request
   - Implement a time-triggered processor that handles queue entries in batches
   - Provide priority levels for critical sync operations

   **Optimizations:**
   - Process queue in small batches (10-15 entries) to prevent timeouts
   - Implement status tracking for monitoring and troubleshooting
   - Apply intelligent sorting to prioritize important updates
   - Purge completed entries to maintain queue performance

   **Limitations:**
   - Queue processing adds latency to real-time updates
   - Queue sheet itself becomes a potential bottleneck at scale
   - Time-based triggers have minimum intervals (1 minute)
   - Manual intervention needed if queue processing fails

2. **Locking Mechanism**:

   **Implementation Approach:**
   - Leverage Google's LockService for critical section protection
   - Implement proper timeout handling for lock acquisition
   - Structure code to minimize lock duration
   - Use row-specific locking where possible to reduce contention

   **Optimizations:**
   - Keep lock sections as short as possible
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when locks cannot be obtained
   - Use optimistic concurrency control for non-critical operations
   - Apply batch updates to minimize lock/unlock cycles

   **Limitations:**
   - Lock timeouts (maximum 30 seconds) may be insufficient for complex operations
   - Lock service has its own quotas and limitations
   - Global locks can create system-wide bottlenecks
   - Lock management adds complexity to error handling

3. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
   
   **Implementation Approach:**
   - Apply timestamp-based "last write wins" approach for simple conflicts
   - Implement version tracking for critical data elements
   - Maintain change history for audit and recovery purposes
   - Create merge strategies for compatible concurrent changes
   
   **Optimizations:**
   - Use column-based structure to minimize conflict surface area
   - Implement differential updates to reduce collision probability
   - Apply semantic conflict resolution for specific data types
   - Create notification system for detected conflicts
   
   **Limitations:**
   - Some conflicts may require manual resolution
   - History tracking increases storage requirements
   - Complex merge logic can introduce bugs
   - Last-write-wins may not be appropriate for all data types

This approach distributes updates over time and ensures that even with many simultaneous sheet modifications, the Master Portfolio Sheet remains consistent and accurate.

### Scalability Optimizations

The short-term solution includes several scalability optimizations to ensure it works efficiently even as the number of member sheets approaches the 1,000 member target:

1. **Tiered Scanning Approach**:
   - **Quick Scans**: Frequent scans that only look at recently modified files
   - **Full Scans**: Less frequent (e.g., daily) scans that process all files but prioritize by creation date
   - This strategy minimizes unnecessary rescanning of unchanged files

2. **Smart Registry Schema**:
   - **Creation & Modification Timestamps**: Used to prioritize processing and track changes
   - **Priority Field**: Enables intelligent processing order with important sheets first
   - **Sync Status Tracking**: Helps identify and resolve issues quickly

3. **Caching & Persistence Strategies**:
   - **Timestamp Caching**: Store last scan times to enable incremental processing
   - **Priority Queue**: Persistent queue for sheets that need attention
   - **Registry Metadata**: Rich metadata to avoid unnecessary file operations

4. **Efficient Processing Techniques**:
   - **Batch Processing**: Prevents timeout issues by processing files in manageable batches
   - **Sorting by Date**: Processes newest sheets first for better user experience
   - **Exponential Backoff**: Automatically adjusts processing schedule when hitting rate limits

5. **File Query Optimization**:
   - Using Drive API query parameters rather than retrieving all files and filtering in code
   - Applying server-side sorting to get the most relevant files first
   - Using mime type filters to only retrieve spreadsheet files

These optimizations work together to ensure the system can handle the full 1,000 members without performance degradation, while setting the stage for the eventual transition to the BigQuery-based solution for truly unlimited scale.

```

#### 4. Email Delivery Cost Considerations

While we'll continue using HubSpot API as our primary delivery method for consistency, it's worth noting the cost comparison for future scaling decisions:

**HubSpot API (Primary Solution)**:
- Leverages existing HubSpot implementation from short-term solution
- Provides consistent user experience throughout the transition
- Includes built-in analytics and marketing features

**Amazon Pinpoint (Cost-Effective Alternative)**:
- Email sending: 30,000 × $0.0001 = $3/week ≈ $12/month
- Endpoint targeting: 25,000 × $0.0012 = $30/month
- **Total**: ~$42/month

This represents significant potential cost savings at scale, which may be considered as member numbers grow beyond 30,000.
