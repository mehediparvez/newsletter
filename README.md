1. **Google Apps Script** (Selected): 
   - Native integration with Google Sheets
   - No additional costs or third-party dependencies
   - Familiar to most Google Workspace users
   - Faster implementation timeline

2. **Make (Integromat)**: 
   - More visual workflow builder
   - Better for complex multi-system integrations
   - Monthly subscription costs
   - Additional learning curve

3. **n8n**:
   - Self-hosted option provides better data ownership
   - Open-source with fair-code license
   - Requires server setup and maintenance
   - More complex implementation timeline

Google Apps Script was selected for the short-term solution due to its native integration with Google Sheets and ability to meet the October 30 deadline with the least complexity.

#### Key Components:

1. **Member Portfolio Sheets**: Individual Google Sheets for each member containing their asset lists
2. **Master Portfolio Sheet**: Centralized sheet that aggregates all member data
3. **Research Updates Sheet**: Weekly research data maintained by the research team
4. **Google Apps Script**: Scripts for data synchronization and newsletter generation
5. **HubSpot API**: Email delivery with personalization and unsubscribe tracking

### Low-Level Design

#### 1. Data Structure

**Member Portfolio Sheet**
```
| Member ID | Assets   | Associate | Notes | Interests |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| email     | SOL      |           |       | AI        |
|           | ETH      |           |       | Memecoins |
```

**Research Updates Sheet**
```
| Assets | Default Message                        | Oct 13 | Oct 20 | Oct 27    | Nov 3 |
|--------|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| BTC    | Nothing new to report, see YSL Hub... | -      | -      | BTC ETFs... | -     |
| ETH    | Nothing new to report, see YSL Hub... | -      | -      | -         | -     |
| Pendle | Nothing new to report, see YSL Hub... | -      | Pendle... | -         | -     |
```

**Master Portfolio Sheet** (created by sync script)
```
| MemberID           | BTC | ETH | SOL | USDC | DOGE | ... | LastSynced          | SourceSheetURL          |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-----|---------------------|------------------------|
| john@example.com  | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    | 1    | ... | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | https://docs.google... |
| sarah@example.com | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1    | 0    | ... | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | https://docs.google... |
```

This column-based structure is efficient because:
1. There are a finite number of cryptocurrencies (~30+)
2. Each member needs only one row instead of multiple rows
3. Reduces data redundancy and improves lookup efficiency
4. Minimizes concurrency conflicts during simultaneous updates

#### 2. Synchronization Process

**A. Initial Setup**:

1. Create a Master Portfolio Sheet to aggregate all member portfolio data
2. Create a "Member Registry" tab within the Master Sheet to track all member sheets
3. Write an Apps Script project attached to the Master Portfolio Sheet to manage all synchronization
4. Configure the Apps Script to read all member sheets from the registry and populate the master sheet
5. Set up a system for registering new member sheets and adding them to the registry

**B. Member Sheet Registry**:

The Member Registry tab in the Master Sheet keeps track of all individual member sheets with enhanced metadata for scalability:

```
| SheetID        | MemberEmail       | SheetName  | LastSynced          | SyncStatus | CreatedDate         | ModifiedDate        | Priority |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 1Abc...XYZ    | john@example.com  | Portfolio  | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | SUCCESS    | 2025-10-01T10:00:00 | 2025-10-15T14:30:00 | 1        |
| 2Def...123    | sarah@example.com | Portfolio  | 2025-10-15T14:35:00 | SUCCESS    | 2025-10-05T11:30:00 | 2025-10-15T14:35:00 | 2        |
```

This enhanced registry enables:
- Dynamic discovery of all member sheets without hardcoding IDs
- Tracking sync status for each member sheet
- Timestamp-based incremental processing for scalability
- Prioritization of syncs based on modification time or importance
- Adding new member sheets without modifying code
- Admin interface for managing member sheets and troubleshooting

**C. Apps Script Project Structure**:

The synchronization logic resides in a single Apps Script project that is bound to the Master Portfolio Sheet:

1. **Central Management**: All code is maintained in one place for easier updates and maintenance
2. **Permission Model**: The script runs with the permissions of the Master Portfolio Sheet owner
3. **Member Sheet Registry**: A separate sheet tab in the Master Sheet tracks all member sheets
4. **Dynamic Sheet Access**: No hardcoding of sheet IDs - all member sheets are discovered and tracked in the registry
5. **Cross-Sheet Access**: The script has read access to member sheets and read/write access to the Master Sheet

**D. Member Sheet Registration - Optimized Folder Monitor Approach**:

The system uses a highly optimized folder monitoring approach for member sheet registration aligned with the client's workflow diagram. This process corresponds to the starting point in the workflow where Customer Portfolio Sheets are first accessed.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Tiered Scanning System**: 
   - Daily full scans of the member folder to catch any missed sheets
   - Frequent incremental scans that only check recently modified files
   - Smart timestamp tracking to minimize redundant processing

2. **Priority-Based Processing**:
   - Process newest sheets first for better user experience
   - Maintain a persistent priority queue for failed or important sheets
   - Implement throttling to avoid Google API rate limits

3. **Batch Processing Logic**: 
   - Process files in small batches (25-50 at a time)
   - Schedule automatic continuation for large folders
   - Use exponential backoff when approaching quota limits

**Optimizations:**
- Store last scan timestamps to enable efficient incremental processing
- Track sheet metadata (creation/modification dates) to identify only changed files
- Implement caching to avoid redundant Google Drive API calls
- Apply server-side filtering and sorting via Drive API query parameters
- Use registry-based approach to avoid re-processing already registered sheets

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- Google Apps Script's 6-minute execution timeout requires careful batching
- Drive API has rate limits that necessitate controlled processing speeds
- Each file access requires a separate API call, which can be expensive at scale
- Large member folders (approaching 1,000) will need multiple scan batches
- Manual intervention may be required for persistent processing errors
```

**E. Trigger-Based Sync**:

This component handles the "Sync portfolio data from Customer Sheets" step in the client's flowchart, triggering whenever a member updates their portfolio.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Event-Based Architecture**: 
   - Install change triggers on all registered member sheets
   - Automatically detect when a portfolio is modified
   - Execute synchronization only when necessary

2. **Data Extraction Process**:
   - Parse the member's Google Sheet to identify their assets
   - Extract relevant portfolio data using column mappings
   - Transform data into the standardized format for the Master Sheet

3. **Master Sheet Update Process**:
   - Locate or create the member's row in the Master Portfolio Sheet
   - Update asset columns with binary indicators (1=has asset, 0=doesn't have)
   - Maintain metadata including last sync time and source URL

**Optimizations:**
- Use registry lookups to quickly validate registered sheets
- Implement change detection to avoid unnecessary processing
- Apply locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent update conflicts
- Use batch writes when updating the master sheet
- Maintain audit logs for troubleshooting and recovery

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- Google Apps Script triggers have quotas that limit activation frequency
- Simultaneous edits across many sheets can cause trigger queue backlogs
- Each trigger execution has independent authentication context
- Script may need to handle permission issues if sheet owners differ
- Registry must be kept consistent to ensure proper sheet tracking
```

#### 3. Newsletter Generation Process

This process covers the central portion of the client's flowchart, where Customer Portfolio data is matched with Research Updates to generate personalized newsletters.

**A. Weekly Newsletter Workflow**:

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieve current week's research data from the Research Updates Sheet
   - Load Master Portfolio Sheet containing all member asset information
   - Create optimized lookup structures for fast data matching

2. **Matching Process**:
   - For each member in the Master Sheet, extract their portfolio assets
   - Match each asset against current research updates
   - Filter to include only updates relevant to the member's portfolio
   - Handle special cases like default messages for assets with no updates

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process members in batches of 50 to avoid timeout issues
   - Track progress to enable resuming if execution is interrupted
   - Implement a queue system for very large member bases

**Optimizations:**
- Use in-memory data structures like Maps for O(1) lookups
- Leverage column-based structure for efficient portfolio data extraction

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- Large member bases approaching 1,000 will require multiple batch executions
- Content size limitations may apply to very large portfolios
- Template rendering performance can degrade with many asset updates
- Memory limitations in Apps Script environment (50MB limit)
- Weekly processing window needs to accommodate full member base

**B. Newsletter Content Generation**:

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Template Management**:
   - Maintain base HTML templates with placeholders for dynamic content
   - Support personalization tokens for member-specific information
   - Implement responsive email design for various device compatibility

2. **Content Assembly**:
   - Generate personalized asset sections based on portfolio matches
   - Apply consistent formatting and styling to research updates
   - Insert appropriate fallback content for empty sections
   - Include personalized greeting and footer information

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Validate generated content for HTML compliance
   - Ensure all links and images are properly formatted
   - Apply length limitations to prevent oversized emails
   - Generate preview versions for testing
```

#### 4. HubSpot Integration

This component handles the "Send Email Address + Email Content to HubSpot Sender" portion of the client's flowchart, delivering personalized newsletters to members.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **API Integration**:
   - Leverage HubSpot's Single Send API for targeted email delivery
   - Set up OAuth or API key authentication for secure access
   - Configure proper email templates in HubSpot for consistent branding
   - Map dynamic content fields to HubSpot custom properties

2. **Delivery Process**:
   - Prepare email payload with recipient information and personalized content
   - Submit requests to HubSpot's API with appropriate authentication
   - Process responses to confirm successful delivery
   - Track email status for reporting and retry purposes

3. **Contact Management**:
   - Ensure all members exist as contacts in HubSpot
   - Update contact properties with relevant member information
   - Apply proper list segmentation for tracking and analytics
   - Handle unsubscribe preferences and compliance requirements

**Optimizations:**
- Batch API requests to minimize network overhead
- Implement connection pooling for API efficiency
- Apply rate limiting to respect HubSpot's API quotas
- Cache authentication tokens to reduce unnecessary token requests
- Use compression for large content payloads

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- HubSpot API has rate limits that must be respected (10 requests/second)
- Single Send API has volume limitations for enterprise tiers
- Large HTML content may need special handling to avoid truncation
- API response times may vary under high load conditions
- OAuth token expiration requires refresh handling
```

#### 5. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

This component handles failure recovery and ensures reliable delivery across the entire workflow, especially crucial for the "Pass" or "Fail" decision points in the client's flowchart.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Implement structured logging for all operations
   - Record detailed information about successes and failures
   - Maintain dedicated log sheets for each system component
   - Enable administrators to review system performance

2. **Failure Detection**:
   - Implement try-catch blocks around all critical operations
   - Classify errors into recoverable vs. non-recoverable categories
   - Detect common failure patterns (API limits, timeouts, permissions)
   - Monitor system health through status dashboards

3. **Retry Strategy**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for temporary failures
   - Set maximum retry attempts to prevent infinite retry loops
   - Schedule delayed retries for rate-limited operations
   - Prioritize critical operations in retry queues

4. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Maintain transaction logs for incomplete operations
   - Implement idempotent operations where possible
   - Provide manual override capabilities for administrators
   - Create self-healing mechanisms for common failure scenarios

**Optimizations:**
- Use batch processing to minimize failure impact
- Implement checkpoint systems to resume interrupted operations
- Leverage distributed state tracking via the registry
- Apply circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- Cache successful results to avoid redundant processing

**Limitations and Constraints:**
- Complex retry logic increases system complexity
- Recovery operations consume additional quota allowances
- Some failures may require manual intervention (e.g., permission issues)
- Persistent failures may need escalation procedures
- Time-sensitive operations may have limited retry windows
```

### Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1 (Oct 15-21)**:
   - Create Master Portfolio Sheet with column-based structure
   - Develop optimized Member Registry with enhanced metadata
   - Implement initial sync script with locking mechanism
   - Set up change triggers and queue system
   - Test data synchronization for a subset of users (100-200 members)

2. **Week 2 (Oct 22-30)**:
   - Implement tiered folder scanning approach with caching
   - Complete newsletter generation logic with batch processing
   - Integrate with HubSpot API and implement templating
   - Add comprehensive error handling, logging, and retry logic
   - Stress test with simulated 1,000-member load
   - Deploy for production use with monitoring system

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Google Apps Script Execution Limits**:
   - 6-minute timeout per execution
   - Need for batch processing (50-100 members per batch)
   - Daily quota limits on API calls

2. **Synchronization Challenges**:
   - Ensuring all member sheet changes are captured
   - Handling conflicts or corrupted data
   - Concurrent update management (see Concurrency Handling section below)

3. **Email Delivery**:
   - HubSpot Single Send API rate limits
   - Monitoring email deliverability

4. **Data Structure Considerations**:
   - The column-based Master Sheet structure significantly improves efficiency
   - Limited by the total number of cryptocurrencies (finite set of ~30-100 assets)
   - Each member requires only a single row regardless of portfolio size
   - Minimizes Google Sheets' 5 million cell limit impact
   - Column-based structure allows atomic updates to a single member row, reducing concurrent update conflicts

### Concurrency Handling

A critical challenge in the short-term solution is handling concurrent updates to the Master Portfolio Sheet, especially relevant to the interconnected flows in the client's diagram where multiple processes must coordinate.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple Apps Script triggers attempting to update the Master Sheet simultaneously
- **Data Corruption**: One update might overwrite another's changes
- **Quota Exhaustion**: Many simultaneous executions could quickly hit Google Apps Script quotas
- **Timeout Failures**: Complex updates might exceed the 6-minute execution limit

#### Recommended Approach:

1. **Implement a Queue System**:

   **Implementation Approach:**
   - Create a dedicated SyncQueue sheet to track pending updates
   - Record sheet ID, member email, timestamp, and status for each update request
   - Implement a time-triggered processor that handles queue entries in batches
   - Provide priority levels for critical sync operations

   **Optimizations:**
   - Process queue in small batches (10-15 entries) to prevent timeouts
   - Implement status tracking for monitoring and troubleshooting
   - Apply intelligent sorting to prioritize important updates
   - Purge completed entries to maintain queue performance

   **Limitations:**
   - Queue processing adds latency to real-time updates
   - Queue sheet itself becomes a potential bottleneck at scale
   - Time-based triggers have minimum intervals (1 minute)
   - Manual intervention needed if queue processing fails

2. **Locking Mechanism**:

   **Implementation Approach:**
   - Leverage Google's LockService for critical section protection
   - Implement proper timeout handling for lock acquisition
   - Structure code to minimize lock duration
   - Use row-specific locking where possible to reduce contention

   **Optimizations:**
   - Keep lock sections as short as possible
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when locks cannot be obtained
   - Use optimistic concurrency control for non-critical operations
   - Apply batch updates to minimize lock/unlock cycles

   **Limitations:**
   - Lock timeouts (maximum 30 seconds) may be insufficient for complex operations
   - Lock service has its own quotas and limitations
   - Global locks can create system-wide bottlenecks
   - Lock management adds complexity to error handling

3. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
   
   **Implementation Approach:**
   - Apply timestamp-based "last write wins" approach for simple conflicts
   - Implement version tracking for critical data elements
   - Maintain change history for audit and recovery purposes
   - Create merge strategies for compatible concurrent changes
   
   **Optimizations:**
   - Use column-based structure to minimize conflict surface area
   - Implement differential updates to reduce collision probability
   - Apply semantic conflict resolution for specific data types
   - Create notification system for detected conflicts
   
   **Limitations:**
   - Some conflicts may require manual resolution
   - History tracking increases storage requirements
   - Complex merge logic can introduce bugs
   - Last-write-wins may not be appropriate for all data types

This approach distributes updates over time and ensures that even with many simultaneous sheet modifications, the Master Portfolio Sheet remains consistent and accurate.

### Scalability Optimizations

The short-term solution includes several scalability optimizations to ensure it works efficiently even as the number of member sheets approaches the 1,000 member target:

1. **Tiered Scanning Approach**:
   - **Quick Scans**: Frequent scans that only look at recently modified files
   - **Full Scans**: Less frequent (e.g., daily) scans that process all files but prioritize by creation date
   - This strategy minimizes unnecessary rescanning of unchanged files

2. **Smart Registry Schema**:
   - **Creation & Modification Timestamps**: Used to prioritize processing and track changes
   - **Priority Field**: Enables intelligent processing order with important sheets first
   - **Sync Status Tracking**: Helps identify and resolve issues quickly

3. **Caching & Persistence Strategies**:
   - **Timestamp Caching**: Store last scan times to enable incremental processing
   - **Priority Queue**: Persistent queue for sheets that need attention
   - **Registry Metadata**: Rich metadata to avoid unnecessary file operations

4. **Efficient Processing Techniques**:
   - **Batch Processing**: Prevents timeout issues by processing files in manageable batches
   - **Sorting by Date**: Processes newest sheets first for better user experience
   - **Exponential Backoff**: Automatically adjusts processing schedule when hitting rate limits

5. **File Query Optimization**:
   - Using Drive API query parameters rather than retrieving all files and filtering in code
   - Applying server-side sorting to get the most relevant files first
   - Using mime type filters to only retrieve spreadsheet files

These optimizations work together to ensure the system can handle the full 1,000 members without performance degradation, while setting the stage for the eventual transition to the BigQuery-based solution for truly unlimited scale.

## Long-Term Solution (30,000+ Members)

### High-Level Design

The long-term solution transitions from Google Apps Script to a more scalable architecture using BigQuery for data storage and Amazon Pinpoint for email delivery, while still preserving Google Sheets as the input interface. This architecture ensures true data ownership and prepares the system for future AI and LLM integration.

![Long-Term Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/example2.png) *(Diagram placeholder)*

#### Technology Selection Rationale

1. **BigQuery**:
   - Full data ownership with structured SQL access
   - Designed for analytics on large datasets
   - Unlimited scalability for growing member base
   - Strong integration with AI/ML services for future enhancements

2. **Looker Studio**:
   - Direct integration with BigQuery
   - Custom dashboards for monitoring system performance
   - Visual analytics for portfolio trends and newsletter effectiveness
   - Shareable reports for stakeholders

3. **AWS Services vs. All-Google Solution**:
   - AWS Pinpoint offers significantly lower costs at scale than alternatives
   - Hybrid architecture leverages strengths of both platforms
   - Future-proof design with multiple integration options

#### Key Components:

1. **Member Portfolio Sheets**: Remain as input interface for members
2. **Google Apps Script**: Handles sync from sheets to BigQuery
3. **BigQuery**: Central data warehouse for all portfolio and research data
4. **Looker Studio**: Analytics dashboards and reporting
5. **Amazon Pinpoint**: Scalable email delivery service
6. **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for data processing and newsletter generation

### Low-Level Design

#### 1. Data Structure in BigQuery

**Members Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `project.newsletter.members` (
  member_id STRING,
  email STRING,
  name STRING,
  create_date TIMESTAMP,
  status STRING,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Portfolios Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `project.newsletter.portfolios` (
  portfolio_id STRING,
  member_id STRING,
  asset STRING,
  type STRING,
  source_sheet_url STRING,
  last_synced TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Research Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `project.newsletter.research` (
  asset STRING,
  week_date DATE,
  update STRING,
  default_message STRING,
  created_by STRING,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Newsletter Log Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE `project.newsletter.newsletter_logs` (
  log_id STRING,
  member_id STRING,
  send_date TIMESTAMP,
  status STRING,
  error_message STRING,
  content STRING
);
```

#### 2. Sheet to BigQuery Synchronization

**A. Google Apps Script Sync**:

```javascript
function syncSheetsToBigQuery() {
  // Get all member sheets
  const memberSheets = getAllMemberSheets();
  
  // Process in batches
  const BATCH_SIZE = 100;
  for (let i = 0; i < memberSheets.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
    const batch = memberSheets.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
    processBatchSync(batch);
  }
}

function processBatchSync(sheetBatch) {
  // Extract data from each sheet
  const portfolioData = [];
  
  for (const sheetInfo of sheetBatch) {
    const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(sheetInfo.id).getSheetByName(sheetInfo.sheetName);
    const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
    
    // Extract member ID and assets
    const memberId = extractMemberId(data);
    const assets = extractAssets(data);
    
    // Add to batch data
    for (const asset of assets) {
      portfolioData.push({
        portfolio_id: Utilities.getUuid(),
        member_id: memberId,
        asset: asset,
        type: 'Portfolio',
        source_sheet_url: sheetInfo.url,
        last_synced: new Date().toISOString()
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Send to BigQuery using API
  const payload = {
    rows: portfolioData
  };
  
  // Use BigQuery API to insert data
  UrlFetchApp.fetch(`https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/datasets/${DATASET_ID}/tables/${TABLE_ID}/insertAll`, {
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${getAccessToken()}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    payload: JSON.stringify(payload)
  });
}
```

**B. Scheduled Syncs and Triggers**:

1. Daily full sync from all sheets to BigQuery
2. Change triggers for real-time updates
3. Error logging and retry mechanisms

**C. Handling Concurrent Updates**:

Unlike the short-term solution, BigQuery is designed to handle high-volume concurrent operations. When 100 or even 1,000 Google Sheets change simultaneously:

1. **Atomicity**: BigQuery's insertAll API maintains atomicity for each batch insertion
2. **Higher Concurrency Limits**: BigQuery can handle thousands of concurrent write operations
3. **No Central Bottleneck**: Each sheet sync operates independently without contention
4. **Streaming Buffer**: BigQuery's streaming buffer absorbs burst traffic
5. **Automatic Retries**: The BigQuery client library implements exponential backoff and retries

Example of resilient BigQuery sync code:

```javascript
function syncSheetToBigQuery(sheetId, sheetData) {
  const retries = 3;
  let attempt = 0;
  
  while (attempt < retries) {
    try {
      // Prepare data as before
      const portfolioData = preparePortfolioData(sheetId, sheetData);
      
      // Use BigQuery insertAll API with automatic retries
      const result = BigQuery.Datasets.Tables.insertAll({
        rows: portfolioData.map(item => ({ json: item }))
      }, PROJECT_ID, DATASET_ID, TABLE_ID);
      
      // Check for partial failures and handle if needed
      if (result.insertErrors && result.insertErrors.length > 0) {
        logPartialFailures(result.insertErrors);
      }
      
      return;
    } catch (e) {
      attempt++;
      if (attempt >= retries) {
        logSyncFailure(sheetId, e.message);
        throw e;
      }
      
      // Exponential backoff
      Utilities.sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Newsletter Generation with BigQuery and AWS

**A. Query for Newsletter Generation**:

```sql
-- Get all member portfolios matched with current research
SELECT 
  m.member_id,
  m.email,
  p.asset,
  IFNULL(r.update, r.default_message) as asset_update
FROM 
  `project.newsletter.members` m
JOIN 
  `project.newsletter.portfolios` p ON m.member_id = p.member_id
LEFT JOIN 
  `project.newsletter.research` r ON p.asset = r.asset AND r.week_date = CURRENT_DATE()
WHERE 
  m.status = 'ACTIVE'
ORDER BY 
  m.email, p.asset;
```

**B. AWS Lambda Function for Newsletter Processing**:

```javascript
// AWS Lambda function (Node.js)
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const { BigQuery } = require('@google-cloud/bigquery');
    const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
    const pinpoint = new AWS.Pinpoint();
    
    // Initialize BigQuery client
    const bigquery = new BigQuery();
    
    // Get current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
    
    // Query to get all newsletter content
    const query = `
      SELECT 
        m.member_id,
        m.email,
        p.asset,
        IFNULL(r.update, r.default_message) as asset_update
      FROM 
        \`${process.env.PROJECT_ID}.newsletter.members\` m
      JOIN 
        \`${process.env.PROJECT_ID}.newsletter.portfolios\` p ON m.member_id = p.member_id
      LEFT JOIN 
        \`${process.env.PROJECT_ID}.newsletter.research\` r ON p.asset = r.asset AND r.week_date = '${today}'
      WHERE 
        m.status = 'ACTIVE'
      ORDER BY 
        m.email, p.asset;

#### 4. Amazon Pinpoint vs HubSpot Cost Comparison

For 30,000 weekly newsletters:

**Amazon Pinpoint**:
- Email sending: 30,000 × $0.0001 = $3/week ≈ $12/month
- Endpoint targeting: 25,000 × $0.0012 = $30/month
- **Total**: ~$42/month (without dashboard)

**HubSpot Marketing Hub Enterprise**:
- Starting at $3,600/month
- Includes other marketing features

#### 5. Migration Strategy

## Conclusion

This document outlines two complementary approaches to the personalized newsletter system:

1. **Short-Term Solution**: Google Sheets + Apps Script + HubSpot for 1,000 members
   - Quick to implement before the October 30 deadline
   - Selected Google Apps Script over Make/n8n for speed and native integration
   - Leverages existing Google Sheets infrastructure
   - Dynamic member sheet registry for easy onboarding
   - Suitable for the current scale of operations
   - Efficient column-based Master Sheet structure

2. **Long-Term Solution**: Google Sheets + BigQuery + Looker Studio + AWS for 30,000+ members
   - Scalable architecture that preserves Google Sheets as input interface
   - True data ownership with BigQuery as the central warehouse
   - Advanced analytics and reporting through Looker Studio
   - Significantly more cost-effective at scale
   - AI/LLM-ready data structure for future enhancements
   - Robust and maintainable for long-term growth

The column-based Master Sheet structure provides several advantages:
- Reduced data redundancy with one row per member
- More efficient concurrent updates with fewer conflicts
- Faster lookups and processing for newsletter generation
- Better scalability within the Google Sheets environment
- Simpler transition path to the long-term BigQuery solution

By implementing the short-term solution now with the optimized data structure and planning for the gradual transition to the long-term architecture, the newsletter system can grow smoothly with the business without disrupting operations or requiring a complete overhaul. The approach balances immediate needs (October 30 deadline) with long-term considerations like data ownership, scalability, and AI-readiness.
