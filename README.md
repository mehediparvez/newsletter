"Thank you, for taking the time to review this. Please watch this video here: https://www.loom.com/share/38d5d956a942478a815daddd93ebd942


I am looking to automate based on the following:


- You and I have a deadline of Oct. 30 to have this set up and working.
- My members need to receive a weekly email that is personalized to them based on updates from my research team that match each individuals portfolio of investments.
- I have 1000 members with their own unique portfolio spreadsheet with a list of assets they hold or are interested in for their personal portfolios.
- I have a team of researchers who will be aggregating their research for each portfolio/newsletter query.
- Using google sheets for the members portfolio is a must, so a solution is needed knowing this. I am open to any and all options, otherwise.


Send me your solution for getting personalized newsletters out each week to my members, matching their portfolio of assets to my teams research. I am paying you $100 to receive your submission and will hire you out at your hourly rate if I choose to work with you.

Let me know if you have any questions and I look forward to hearing from you!
"  "0:00 Hi, my name is Sean, with Yield School, and I have a specific need that I want to hire you for, okay?
0:08 But I'm sending this out to multiple people, and I'm looking for the best solution, and the best person to partner with in building this.
0:15 I have a specific deadline of October 30th, and that's in roughly two weeks, as you know, okay? So I'm gonna walk through one of- I'm needing, and yeah, again, thanks for just going through this with me.
0:29 So the first thing to note is that our end result is going to be a customized newsletter that is emailed to our customers once per week, and that newsletter needs to have information on assets that they invest in, okay?
0:47 Okay. So, for example, I need to know if they have Bitcoin in their portfolio, and Ethereum, and whatever else, right?
0:58 It doesn't matter. That research is going to be done by my team. The member is going to have a portfolio of assets, a list of assets that w- We will be populating into a spreadsheet, and then we need the newsletter to be customized to them.
1:25 Okay? Meaning, let's look at this. The members, let's say we have a thousand, two thousand. We will have a unique spreadsheet for each individual one, and that's where this gets- It's a little bit difficult.
1:37 So I need solutions for this. Okay? Now, right now, the spreadsheet looks like this. What we can do is we can aggregate information, right?
1:45 We can give their assets, we can, you know, give who they're assigned to, maybe some notes on them, maybe some interest.
1:52 That's all future stuff. Right now, all I need to know is, uh, for example, um, you know, uh, let's see.
2:00 Thank you. Remember ID? And let's say it's just their email. Right? So we have the unique identifier that matches them.
2:07 That email is then going to be paired up with them later. But we can list out the assets that they hold in port, their portfolio.
2:14 They have their unique identifier. And we need all that information to float. So let me walk you through this. We have multiple newsletter or multiple, uh, Google Sheet.
2:24 It's with their portfolios. All right? Each member has their own. We need to pull the data from the customer's sheet.
2:32 Okay? So it needs to request it. And then we need to get it. Right? And then we need to match that data with the research.
2:39 And my research team will be going through and doing the research on those assets. And let's say we dump it in, uh, just as an example, a Google Sheet like this, uh, .
2:48 . . Uh, and let's say that for each week, because we have a weekly newsletter. Let's say we have no updates on Bitcoin this week.
2:55 No updates this week. But this week, on October 27th, we have an update. Right? So I need to match the headers.
3:01 I need to match the format. Uh, and again, this is just my way of looking at it. I'm seeking . . . solutions.
3:09 If there is a better way or a different way, let's . let's look at it. But again, short term, right now, I'm looking at, you know, do we use Google Apps Scripts?
3:18 Uh, do we use Make or N-A-N? Do we use some of those different agents to, you know, call and retrieve?
3:24 Uh, but long term, I'm, I'm looking to maybe move towards BigQuery. Um, maybe do some, some Looker Studio. Things like that, because we eventually want to truly own our data.
3:34 Um, we want to house it ourselves, and there's, there's a lot. Bye bye. More information that I will be getting, uh, and dumping in here to curate a customized experience and newsletter for our members.
3:47 Okay? But right now, the best solution that I can think of is this option. Because the truth is, right now we're building a portfolio, why I have a team of consultants that are consulting with our members, and they're going through a portfolio- both sides.
4:01 So we might say you have Solana or Bitcoin, you know, here's the current price, here's how many tokens you have, here's the U.S.
4:09 value, uh, and U.S. dollars. Now, I don't need to know about these things necessarily. I don't necessarily care about those at all.
4:18 I just need to know what assets do they have. And then we might introduce another column down here. Uh, let's say there was an additional buy.
4:25 A box that says, assets you're interested in. Well, what I want to do then is have that information, match up with the research, because my research team will be doing that research.
4:37 We need to then make the outputs match. But think about it like this. If we loop through all the customers and we.
4:49 Add all the research. We need to pair that with a weekly newsletter body. Because we'll be doing a weekly newsletter that is probably 90% of what they'll receive in their email.
5:02 But then that extra 10% is going to be grabbing the research and matching it up with assets in their portfolio.
5:09 We'll send it to an email builder, let's say, and we'll be using hub spot. As the sender. It's, it's the, uh, the source of truth.
5:18 This is where everything kind of, uh, ends. Because that's what we'll be using for our newsletter. Okay? So, with that said, if there's a better option, a better solution, let me know.
5:29 But right now, I don't see myself going away from a Google sheet that has a something along these lines. Unless there, unless you just have an amazing option that we can work and we can scale, because let's say this grows to 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, uh, new members of ours, we want to be able to curate a
5:52 newsletter that's customized to what they're holding in their portfolio. So I'm open to all sorts of ideas, but in the short term, I need a solution with, Let's say 1,000 portfolios or 500 or whatever.
6:05 Let's say we have 1,000 right now. Do we house them in a Google, uh, drive? And then we can retrieve each individual one.
6:12 I can make this spreadsheet tab go to the front and we can lock it to where, uh, members can't change it.
6:22 My team can't change it. No one can move it. Right? We could hop. I'd this and still make it so that, you know, houses the information because if we're thinking about a CSV file or something like that, we may need to, uh, have it on the very first sheet because what it will do is look for the unique 
6:38 identifier and look for the assets. And all it's doing then is matching them up with the newsletter output. So hopefully that's helpful.
6:46 Uh, I'm going to do my best to get back with you. As soon as possible, but I want from you solutions on how you would accomplish this because my end goal is simple.
6:56 My end goal to make it very, very simple. I need a newsletter that goes out matching up the research my team does with their portfolio.
7:07 And right now I'm willing to look at other options. This is just a solution I came up with real quick.
7:12 I mean, a simple. Heather, and if we see a dash or it's blank, just go to the default, nothing new to report, see, and then we have like a link in the newsletter.
7:22 Uhm, you know, let's just say that's copied down the entire way. Uhm, I wouldn't need to know, uhm, like what would your solution be to house the research?
7:35 Because this is just an easy quick. quick. solution, but if there's a better one, just let me know. Okay? So, thank you again for the time on this.
7:44 Uhm, I'm going to pay you to receive your options. Uh, I hope you agree to the, uh, $100. Because I'm looking for the best solution.
7:53 And yes, I'm, I'm seeking multiple people out on this. And I'm looking for a great communicator, someone that can hit my deadline of October 30th.
8:01 and and make this happen. Let's make this work. Let's work together. Let me know. Let me know. Thanks for watching.
8:07 Look forward to hearing from you. Bye. All right. All right." can we use hubspot for sending emails using hubsport api which will receive the email address and the email content? is there any api endpoint e xist?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, HubSpot provides an API endpoint that allows you to send personalized emails to individual recipients using pre-designed templates. This is achieved through the Marketing Single Send API.
📧 HubSpot Marketing Single Send API

The Single Send API enables you to send emails created in HubSpot's marketing email tool programmatically. You can personalize these emails by injecting dynamic content specific to each recipient.

Key Features:

    Email Templates: Utilize templates designed within HubSpot's email editor.

    Personalization: Inject personalized content using contact properties or custom properties.

    Recipient Details: Specify recipient information such as to, from, cc, bcc, replyTo, and sendId.

    Contact Management: Automatically create or update contact records based on the recipient's email address.

    Status Tracking: Monitor the status of sent emails using the statusId.

Endpoint:

POST /marketing/v4/email/single-send

Request Body Example:

{
  "emailId": 123456,
  "message": {
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "from": "Sender Name <sender@hubspot.com>",
    "sendId": "unique-send-id-001",
    "replyTo": ["reply@example.com"],
    "cc": ["cc@example.com"],
    "bcc": ["bcc@example.com"]
  },
  "contactProperties": [
    { "name": "first_name", "value": "John" },
    { "name": "investment_interest", "value": "Bitcoin" }
  ],
  "customProperties": {
    "investment_update": "Bitcoin price increased by 5% this week."
  }
}

Response Example:

{
  "eventId": {
    "created": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "id": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a"
  },
  "completedAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "statusId": "status-id-001",
  "sendResult": "SENT"
}

For detailed information, refer to the official documentation:
developers.hubspot.com
✅ Requirements

    HubSpot Marketing Hub Enterprise: Access to the Single Send API requires a Marketing Hub Enterprise subscription.

    API Key or OAuth Token: Authentication is necessary to interact with HubSpot's APIs.

    Email Template: An email template must be created and published within HubSpot's email tool.

🔄 Workflow Integration

To automate the process of sending personalized newsletters to your members:

    Member Portfolio Data: Store each member's portfolio in individual Google Sheets.

    Research Aggregation: Your research team compiles updates related to each asset.

    Data Synchronization: Use tools like Google Apps Script or Make (formerly Integromat) to extract data from Google Sheets and match it with the corresponding research updates.

    Email Personalization: Populate the email template with personalized content based on the member's portfolio and the latest research.

    Email Dispatch: Utilize the Single Send API to send the personalized email to each member.

This approach ensures that each member receives a tailored newsletter with relevant updates on their investments.

will we have to personalize the email content before calling the single send api or we can push the dynamic contents to the single send api so that it render the dyanmics content correctly in the template and what does mean by 'emailId' in request body?
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the detailed clarification about your questions regarding HubSpot’s Single Send API:
1️⃣ Personalizing Before vs During API Call

You do not have to fully render the email content yourself before calling the Single Send API. HubSpot handles dynamic content rendering if:

    You use HubSpot email templates with personalization tokens.

    You pass contact properties or custom properties in the API request.

How it works:

    In your HubSpot email template, you can insert placeholders like {{ first_name }}, {{ investment_update }}, etc.

    When you call the API, you provide values for these placeholders in the contactProperties or customProperties fields.

    HubSpot merges these values into the template and sends the final email.

✅ This means you don’t need to manually create the full email body for each member — the API handles it dynamically.
2️⃣ Meaning of emailId in the Request Body

    emailId refers to the unique identifier of the marketing email template you want to send.

    Every email template in HubSpot has an internal ID that you can find in the HubSpot UI or via the Email Templates API

    .

    When you pass emailId in the Single Send API request, HubSpot knows which template to use and will inject the dynamic content you provide.

Example Flow:

    Create a HubSpot email template with placeholders:

Hi {{ first_name }},  

Here are your investment updates this week:  
{{ investment_update }}  

    Call the Single Send API with:

{
  "emailId": 123456,  // your template ID
  "message": {
    "to": "member@example.com"
  },
  "contactProperties": [
    { "name": "first_name", "value": "John" }
  ],
  "customProperties": {
    "investment_update": "Bitcoin +5%, Ethereum -2%"
  }
}

HubSpot will merge the first_name and investment_update into the template and send a personalized email.
✅ Key Notes

    The template must already exist and be published in HubSpot.

    contactProperties are generally for predefined HubSpot contact fields.

    customProperties can be used for any extra dynamic content not in standard contact fields.

    You can send 1000+ personalized emails programmatically, but you may need to consider HubSpot API rate limits and Marketing Hub plan restrictions.

If you want, I can sketch a sample workflow for your 1000 members using Google Sheets + HubSpot API showing exactly how dynamic content for each member can be pushed automatically without manually rendering emails.

Do you want me to do that?

As I need to send 25k personalize email weekly then what will be the secenrio? do i have to make single send api call for each member and is it will be do this and what will be the cost? I want the system should be fault tolerant as I am building a newsletter. Also does the single send api keep track of the unsubscribed memeber so that it does not send email to the unsubscribed member? Also, do we store the email address into the prviously or can send message any email by setting to field during single send api call?
ChatGPT said:

To address your requirements for sending 25,000 personalized emails weekly using HubSpot's Single Send API, here's a comprehensive breakdown:
1️⃣ Sending 25,000 Personalized Emails Weekly

API Call Strategy:

    Single Send API: You can send personalized emails using HubSpot's Single Send API. Each API call can send an email to one recipient. To send 25,000 emails, you would need to make 25,000 individual API calls. However, this approach may not be efficient for large volumes due to rate limits and potential delays.

    SMTP API: Alternatively, consider using HubSpot's SMTP API, which allows you to send emails in bulk. This method can be more efficient for high-volume email sending. You can find more information on the SMTP API here:
    developers.hubspot.com
    .

Rate Limits:

    API Rate Limits: HubSpot's API rate limits vary based on your subscription level. For example, HubSpot Professional and Enterprise users have access to a burst limit of 150 API calls per 10 seconds and a daily limit of 500,000 requests. This means you can make up to 150 API calls every 10 seconds, with a daily cap of 500,000 calls.
    clevyr.com

    Sending Limits: For Marketing Hub Professional or Enterprise users, the monthly email send limits are based on your contact tier. For instance, if you have 10,000 contacts, you can send up to 100,000 emails per month. These limits are separate from API rate limits.
    mpiresolutions.com

Cost Considerations:

    Marketing Hub Professional: Starting at $800/month. Includes access to the Single Send API and email sending capabilities.

    Marketing Hub Enterprise: Starting at $3,600/month. Offers advanced features and higher sending limits.

    Transactional Email Add-On: $600/month. Provides unlimited transactional email sends, dedicated IP, SMTP/API integration, and full CRM integration.
    HubSpot Blog

2️⃣ Fault Tolerance and Scalability

To ensure a fault-tolerant system capable of handling large volumes:

    Retry Mechanism: Implement a retry mechanism in your API calls to handle transient errors.

    Batch Processing: Consider batching your email sends to manage load and reduce the risk of hitting rate limits.

    Monitoring: Set up monitoring to track the status of each email send and handle failures appropriately.

    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage issues like API timeouts or rate limit breaches.

3️⃣ Unsubscribe Management

HubSpot automatically manages unsubscribe preferences:

    Subscription Preferences: Contacts can manage their subscription preferences through HubSpot's subscription management tools.
    HubSpot Knowledge Base

    Unsubscribe Links: Including unsubscribe links in your emails allows recipients to opt out of future communications.
    HubSpot Knowledge Base

    Automatic Updates: When a contact unsubscribes, HubSpot automatically updates their status to reflect their preferences.

You can view and manage unsubscribed contacts through HubSpot's contact management tools.
mpiresolutions.com
4️⃣ Email Address Management

You can send emails to any email address by specifying the recipient in the message field of the Single Send API request. HubSpot will automatically associate the email with a contact record based on the provided email address. If no contact exists, a new record will be created.
developers.hubspot.com

Recommendations:

    Evaluate Your Needs: Determine whether the Single Send API or SMTP API best suits your requirements.

    Consider Upgrading: If you're on a lower-tier plan, consider upgrading to access higher sending limits and additional features.

    Implement Best Practices: Follow best practices for email deliverability and compliance, including managing unsubscribe preferences and monitoring sending activity.

If you need assistance with implementation or further details, feel free to ask!

You said:
is the provided soltuions are suitable for a newsletter? For Now, I want to use Hubspot. also do we have any alternative in amazon?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, the solutions I provided earlier (MailerLite, ActiveCampaign, HubSpot) are all suitable for newsletters, as they support:

    Personalized/dynamic content

    Automation workflows

    Bulk sending and scheduling

    Analytics for tracking engagement

Since you want to use HubSpot for now, that’s perfectly fine. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub Enterprise with the Single Send API or Transactional Email API can handle personalized weekly newsletters efficiently for 1,000–30,000 users, especially if you implement batching and retries for fault tolerance.
✅ Alternatives on Amazon (AWS)

If you want an Amazon-based solution, AWS offers services suitable for newsletter sending:

    Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)

        High-volume email sending service.

        Supports sending personalized emails via API or SMTP.

        Can integrate with your Google Sheets data using Lambda functions or server scripts.

        Cost-effective: pay per email sent.

        Example: 25,000 emails × $0.0001/email = $2.50 per week (very cheap).

    Amazon Pinpoint

        More advanced than SES; designed for targeted marketing campaigns.

        Supports email, SMS, and push notifications.

        Can handle personalization, dynamic content, and tracking.

        Ideal for scaling to tens of thousands of subscribers.

        Built-in analytics to track engagement.

⚡ Recommendation

    Short-term (1,000 users): HubSpot Single Send API is faster to implement because your templates are already in HubSpot and it handles unsubscribes and personalization automatically.

    Long-term (30,000+ users): AWS SES or Pinpoint can be more cost-effective and scalable, especially if you want to manage data outside HubSpot or reduce monthly subscription costs.

If you want, I can draft a HubSpot + Google Sheets workflow for your newsletter that is fault-tolerant and ready to scale to 30k users in the future, using batching and API retries.

Do you want me to do that?
You said:
does Amazon simple email service keeps track of the unsubscribe member types or related functionality for newsletter?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, but not automatically in the same way as HubSpot. Here’s how it works with Amazon SES and related AWS services:
1️⃣ Unsubscribe Handling in Amazon SES

    Amazon SES supports “List-Unsubscribe” headers in your emails.

        This allows recipients to click an unsubscribe link in the email.

        The link should point to your unsubscribe management system, e.g., a web endpoint or Lambda function.

    SES itself does not automatically manage your subscriber list.

        You are responsible for maintaining a suppression list of unsubscribed users.

        SES provides a global suppression list for email addresses that have previously bounced or complained.

2️⃣ Using Amazon Pinpoint (Recommended for Newsletter)

    Pinpoint has built-in subscription management.

        Supports email channels, unsubscribes, and preferences.

        Tracks member types and allows you to segment users based on subscription preferences.

        Handles opt-out links automatically.

    Workflow Example:

        You create a campaign in Pinpoint.

        Users can unsubscribe directly from the email.

        Pinpoint automatically updates the list and prevents sending future emails to unsubscribed users.

3️⃣ Comparison: HubSpot vs SES/Pinpoint
Feature	HubSpot	Amazon SES	Amazon Pinpoint
Unsubscribe management	Automatic	Must implement manually	Automatic
Personalization	Template tokens + API	Manual merge of dynamic content	Template with variables
Analytics	Open rate, clicks, delivery	Limited; must use CloudWatch or custom logging	Built-in reporting
Scalability	High, but subscription cost	Very high, pay per email	Very high, pay per email & engagement

Summary:

    SES: Cheaper, scalable, but you must implement unsubscribe handling and track member preferences yourself.

    Pinpoint: More like HubSpot, built-in subscription and tracking, still cost-effective and scalable.

If you want, I can sketch a full architecture for a newsletter system that starts with HubSpot for 1,000 users now, and later migrates to AWS SES/Pinpoint for 30k+ users, including unsubscribe tracking and personalization workflow.

Do you want me to do that?
You said:
what will be the cost of 30K+ users for AWS pinpoint?
ChatGPT said:

For sending personalized newsletters to over 30,000 users weekly using Amazon Pinpoint, the estimated monthly cost can be broken down as follows:
📧 Email Sending Costs

    Cost per email: $0.0001

    Weekly emails per user: 1

    Total weekly emails: 30,000 emails

    Total monthly emails: 30,000 emails × 4 weeks = 120,000 emails

    Monthly email sending cost: 120,000 × $0.0001 = $12

📍 Endpoint Targeting Costs

Amazon Pinpoint charges for targeting endpoints (e.g., email addresses) beyond the first 5,000 per month:

    Free tier: First 5,000 endpoints per month

    Cost per additional endpoint: $0.0012

    Total endpoints: 30,000

    Billable endpoints: 30,000 - 5,000 = 25,000

    Monthly endpoint targeting cost: 25,000 × $0.0012 = $30

📊 Optional: Deliverability Dashboard

To monitor email deliverability and inbox placement, you can subscribe to the Deliverability Dashboard:

    Monthly subscription: $1,250

    Includes: Reputation monitoring for up to five domains and 25 predictive inbox placement tests

    Optional: Additional domain monitoring at $25 per domain per month

💰 Estimated Monthly Cost Summary
Service Component	Monthly Cost
Email Sending	$12
Endpoint Targeting	$30
Deliverability Dashboard (Optional)	$1,250
Total (without dashboard)	$42
Total (with dashboard)	$1,292
✅ Key Considerations

    Scalability: Amazon Pinpoint is designed to handle large-scale email campaigns, making it suitable for your growing subscriber base.

    Personalization: Supports dynamic content insertion to tailor newsletters to individual recipients.

    Unsubscribe Management: Provides tools to manage and track unsubscribed users, ensuring compliance with email regulations.

    Necessary? For a newsletter to 30k+ users, it’s not strictly required if:

        You already follow email best practices (verified domain, proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC setup, clean lists).

        You are okay with monitoring open rates, bounces, and complaints via the standard Pinpoint metrics.

    Optional but recommended if you want maximum deliverability and compliance, especially at scale.

💡 Short answer: You can start without it, then add it later if deliverability issues arise.
2️⃣ Cost Comparison: HubSpot vs Amazon Pinpoint

Scenario: Sending 25–30k personalized emails weekly (~120k/month).
Feature/Service	HubSpot Marketing Hub (Enterprise)	Amazon Pinpoint
Email Sending	Included in subscription	$0.0001/email → $12/month
Subscriber Limit	10k–100k+, depending on plan	30k endpoints → $30/month
Dynamic Content & Personalization	Built-in templates & tokens	Supported via template variables
Unsubscribe Management	Automatic	Automatic via unsubscribe link
Analytics	Built-in email reports	Standard metrics; dashboard optional
Cost Estimate	$3,600+/month (Enterprise)	$42/month (without dashboard) / $1,292 (with dashboard)

Observations:

    HubSpot: Easier to implement for personalization, template design, and automatic unsubscribe handling. Less technical setup. Expensive for large-scale newsletters.

    Amazon Pinpoint: Extremely cost-effective for large lists. Requires more setup (templates, personalization logic, unsubscribe handling) but scales well. Optional deliverability dashboard adds cost but improves inbox placement.

✅ Recommendation

    Short-term (1,000 users): HubSpot is easier to implement and manage. Fast setup, handles personalization and unsubscribes automatically.

    Long-term (30k+ users): Amazon Pinpoint is much more cost-efficient. Even if you include the optional deliverability dashboard ($1,292/month), it is still cheaper or comparable to HubSpot Enterprise ($3,600+/month).

    Newsletter Deliverability: You can start with Pinpoint without the dashboard, monitor basic metrics, and enable the dashboard later if needed.

If you want, I can draft a complete workflow for a HubSpot + Google Sheets setup for 1,000 users now and a future migration plan to Pinpoint for 30k users, including personalization, unsubscribe handling, and fault-tolerance.

ChatGPT said:

Yes — this is a classic scenario of data aggregation from multiple Google Sheets for personalized newsletter automation. Let me break it down carefully and give short-term and long-term solutions.
🔹 Problem Recap

    Each member has a unique Google Sheet with their portfolio.

    You have research data in a separate sheet.

    You want to aggregate data from all member sheets, match it with research, and send a personalized newsletter.

    Scale: Short-term 1,000 members, long-term 30k+ members.

The main challenge is: pulling data from many sheets efficiently and reliably.
🔹 Short-Term Solution (1,000 Members)
Using Google Apps Script

Why it's feasible:

    Apps Script can access multiple Google Sheets using their Sheet IDs.

    You can write a script to:

        Loop through all member sheet IDs.

        Read portfolio data.

        Match it with your research sheet.

        Build personalized email content.

        Send emails via HubSpot Single Send API (or Gmail/SMTP for testing).

Implementation Steps:

    Central Sheet for Metadata:

        Store each member’s sheet ID and email in a master sheet.

        Example columns: MemberID | Email | SheetID.

    Script to Aggregate Data:

    function aggregateMemberData() {
      const masterSheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById("MASTER_SHEET_ID").getSheetByName("Members");
      const data = masterSheet.getDataRange().getValues(); // MemberID, Email, SheetID
      
      const researchSheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById("RESEARCH_SHEET_ID").getSheetByName("Research");
      const researchData = researchSheet.getDataRange().getValues();
      
      const result = [];
      
      for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
        const email = data[i][1];
        const sheetId = data[i][2];
        const memberSheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(sheetId).getSheetByName("Portfolio");
        const portfolioData = memberSheet.getDataRange().getValues();
        
        // Match portfolio with research
        const updates = portfolioData.map(asset => {
          const research = researchData.find(r => r[0] === asset[0]); // assuming first column = asset
          return research ? `${asset[0]}: ${research[1]}` : `${asset[0]}: No update`;
        });
        
        result.push({ email, updates: updates.join("\n") });
      }
      
      return result;
    }

    Send Emails via HubSpot API:

        Call Single Send API for each member using the personalized content.

        Implement batching and retry logic for reliability.

Pros:

    Quick to implement for ~1,000 members.

    Minimal extra infrastructure.

Cons:

    Apps Script can time out (~6 minutes per execution).

    Not scalable for 10k+ sheets.

    Maintenance becomes hard with more sheets.

Workaround: Process in batches (e.g., 100 members at a time) using triggers or cron jobs.
🔹 Long-Term Solution (30,000+ Members)
Problem with Many Sheets

    Storing 30,000 individual Google Sheets is not practical.

    Reading them dynamically via Apps Script will fail due to timeouts and API quotas.

Recommended Approach

    Centralized Database (Best Practice)

        Instead of multiple sheets, store all member portfolios in one database:

            Google BigQuery

            PostgreSQL/MySQL hosted on a cloud server

            Airtable for smaller scale

    Weekly Automation Workflow

        Step 1: Research team updates research sheet.

        Step 2: Script (Apps Script / Node.js / Python) aggregates portfolios + research from the database.

        Step 3: Generate personalized emails.

        Step 4: Send emails via HubSpot API or Amazon Pinpoint.

    Benefits of Database Approach

        Handles tens of thousands of members efficiently.

        Easier to query and join portfolio + research.

        Fault-tolerant and scalable.

        Supports personalization at scale without multiple spreadsheets.

🔹 Hybrid Approach (Optional)

    Short-term: Use Apps Script + HubSpot for 1,000 members.

    Medium-term: Migrate all member portfolios into a single Google Sheet or database, still using HubSpot.

    Long-term: Move to BigQuery + Amazon Pinpoint, fully scalable for 30k+ members.

✅ Summary Table
Scale	Solution	Pros	Cons
1,000 users	Google Apps Script + HubSpot API	Quick, minimal setup	Limited by execution time, batching needed
30,000+ users	Central database (BigQuery/Postgres) + HubSpot or Pinpoint	Scalable, fault-tolerant	Requires initial migration, cloud infra

If you want, I can draw a diagram showing the full workflow for short-term (1,000 members) and long-term (30k+ members) including Apps Script, HubSpot, and optional AWS migration, which makes it visually easier to implement.

				" assets are name of the cryptocurrency he has invested . In each google sheets for each member we will list down all the cryptocurrency he has inversted or interested and newsletter is about sending the research done by teamd which are stored in the reserach spreadsheet personalize to them
ChatGPT said:

Got it! Your scenario is now very clear:

    Each member has a portfolio sheet listing all cryptocurrencies they own or are interested in.

    Your research team populates a research spreadsheet with updates on cryptocurrencies.

    You want to send a personalized newsletter that contains only the research related to the cryptocurrencies in each member’s portfolio.

Here’s how we can handle it in short-term and long-term setups:
🔹 Short-Term Solution (1,000 members)
Using Google Apps Script + HubSpot API

Workflow:

    Master Sheet:

        Maintain a master Google Sheet with columns: MemberID | Email | SheetID (SheetID = individual portfolio sheet).

    Aggregate Data:

        Apps Script reads each member’s sheet using SpreadsheetApp.openById(sheetId).

        Pull all the Assets column for that member.

        Compare with the Research Sheet:

            Match asset names in the portfolio with the research data.

            Pull research updates for only those assets.

    Generate Personalized Content:

        Build the newsletter content dynamically:

        Hi <Member Name>,

        Here are the latest updates on your portfolio:

        - BTC: [research summary from research sheet]
        - ETH: [research summary]
        - SOL: [research summary]

        If no updates, say “No new updates this week.”

    Send via HubSpot Single Send API:

        For each member, send a Single Send API request with:

            emailId = your newsletter template

            contactProperties = member name/email

            customProperties = the personalized research content

    Fault Tolerance:

        Process members in batches (e.g., 50–100 at a time).

        Retry failed API calls automatically.

        Log errors in a Google Sheet for manual review.

✅ Works well for 1,000 members.
⚠️ Apps Script may timeout if processing all 1,000 at once → batching is essential.
🔹 Long-Term Solution (30,000+ members)
Using a Centralized Database + HubSpot or AWS Pinpoint

Challenges with multiple Google Sheets:

    30k separate sheets → very slow to read via Apps Script, prone to API limits and timeouts.

Recommended Approach:

    Centralized Portfolio Database:

        Move all member portfolios into a single table in a database (BigQuery, PostgreSQL, or even a single Google Sheet if smaller scale).

        Table structure example:

    MemberID | Email | Asset | Type (Owned/Interested)

    Each row = one asset for one member.

Research Table:

    Keep all research updates in a single table with columns:

        Asset | Research Summary | Date

    Personalized Aggregation:

        Use SQL queries or script to join member portfolios with research updates.

        Generate personalized newsletter content per member efficiently.

    Email Delivery:

        Use HubSpot Single Send API for now (if you continue with HubSpot).

        For 30k+ members, consider Amazon Pinpoint for cost efficiency.

    Benefits:

        Scalable: can handle 30k+ members easily.

        Easier to maintain and update portfolios and research.

        Fault-tolerant: retries, logging, and batching are easier.

🔹 Hybrid Approach

    Short-term (1k members): Apps Script + HubSpot → quick, no infra change.

    Long-term (30k+ members): Migrate to centralized DB + HubSpot/Pinpoint → scalable, cost-efficient.

If you want, I can draft a sample Apps Script code that:

    Reads each member’s portfolio sheet

    Matches assets with research sheet

    Builds a personalized newsletter content

    Sends it via HubSpot API

This can serve as a working short-term solution for 1,000 members.

Do you want me to do that?
You said:
the research sheet may look like this "Assets		Oct 13	Oct 20	Oct 27	Nov 3																				
BTC	Nothing new to report, see YSL Research Hub	-	-	BTC ETFs hit all time high	-																				
ETH	Nothing new to report, see YSL Research Hub	-	-	-	-																				
Pendle	Nothing new to report, see YSL Research Hub	-	Pendle partners with Google	-	-																				
XYZ	Nothing new to report, see YSL Research Hub	-	-	-	-																				" now how can i use data structure or other methods to improve the system efficienncy as we know the number of cryptocurrency are not infinite and there maybe 30+ cryptocurrency. can we use better approach for the short time and long time solution for the newsletter ?
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — now we can optimize your system efficiently based on the structure of your research sheet and member portfolios. Since you have limited cryptocurrency types (~30+), we can use efficient data structures and lookup methods to improve performance for both short-term (1,000 members) and long-term (30k+ members).
🔹 Current Challenge

    Each member has a portfolio sheet with a list of cryptocurrencies they hold or are interested in.

    The research sheet has updates per cryptocurrency per week.

    The goal is to send personalized newsletters containing only the research relevant to the member’s portfolio.

Naive approach: Loop through each member → loop through each asset in their portfolio → loop through the research sheet → get updates.

    Complexity: O(M × P × R), where

        M = number of members

        P = number of assets per member

        R = number of assets in research sheet

Even with 30+ cryptocurrencies, this nested loop approach is suboptimal.
🔹 Optimized Approach Using Data Structures
1️⃣ Short-Term (1,000 Members) – Apps Script

Idea: Use a map/dictionary (JavaScript object) for fast lookup of research updates.
Step 1: Preprocess Research Sheet

// Key = asset name, Value = array of updates per week
const researchMap = {};
const researchData = researchSheet.getDataRange().getValues(); // [Assets, Oct13, Oct20, ...]
const headers = researchData[0].slice(1); // Week dates

for (let i = 1; i < researchData.length; i++) {
  const asset = researchData[i][0];
  researchMap[asset] = researchData[i].slice(1); // ['Nothing new...', '-', ...]
}

Step 2: Generate Personalized Newsletter

function generateNewsletter(memberAssets) {
  let newsletter = '';
  memberAssets.forEach(asset => {
    if (researchMap[asset]) {
      // Pick the latest week with an update
      const latestUpdate = researchMap[asset].reverse().find(u => u !== '-');
      newsletter += `- ${asset}: ${latestUpdate || 'No update'}\n`;
    } else {
      newsletter += `- ${asset}: No update\n`;
    }
  });
  return newsletter;
}

✅ Advantages:

    Lookup is O(1) per asset instead of scanning the research sheet each time.

    Minimal execution time even with 1,000 members and 30+ cryptocurrencies.

    Easy to batch and send via HubSpot API.

2️⃣ Long-Term (30,000 Members) – Database Approach

Use a relational database (Postgres, MySQL, or BigQuery):

    Portfolio Table

MemberID | Email | Asset | Type (Owned/Interested)

    Research Table

Asset | Week | Update

    SQL Query to Aggregate Newsletter per Member

SELECT 
  p.MemberID,
  p.Email,
  r.Asset,
  r.Update
FROM 
  Portfolio p
JOIN 
  Research r
ON 
  p.Asset = r.Asset
WHERE 
  r.Week = 'Oct 27';

    Generates all relevant updates per member in a single query.

    Efficient for tens of thousands of members.

    Can then feed results into a script that formats content and calls HubSpot / Pinpoint API.

✅ Advantages:

    Scales easily to 30k+ members.

    No nested loops per member → huge efficiency gain.

    Allows tracking history and weekly updates easily.

3️⃣ Additional Optimization Tips

    Cache Research Data:

        Even in Apps Script, load the research sheet once into a dictionary instead of reading it per member.

    Batch Processing:

        Process members in batches of 50–100 to avoid timeouts and API rate limits.

    Dynamic Templates:

        Use placeholders like {{crypto_updates}} in HubSpot templates.

        Feed pre-formatted updates string into the template via API.

    Avoid Multiple Sheets:

        For short-term, still can use per-member sheets.

        Long-term: merge all portfolios into a single table → reduces API calls and simplifies automation.

🔹 Summary Table
Aspect	Short-Term (1,000 members)	Long-Term (30k+ members)
Data Storage	Individual Google Sheets	Single DB / BigQuery
Aggregation	Apps Script + JS Map	SQL Join Queries
Research Lookup	Map/dictionary O(1)	Indexed DB O(logN)
Email Sending	HubSpot Single Send API	HubSpot / Amazon Pinpoint
Batch Processing	Yes, batch 50–100 members	Batch 500–1,000 members
Fault Tolerance	Retry failed API calls	Retry & logging in scripts

✅ Key Takeaways:

    Short-term: Use Apps Script + map-based lookup for speed.

    Long-term: Use centralized database + SQL join → highly scalable.

    Personalization: Only include relevant research per member, avoid scanning entire sheets.

If you want, I can draft the full Apps Script code for short-term 1,000 members newsletter, using your research sheet and per-member portfolio sheets with map-based lookup — ready to integrate with HubSpot API.

Do you want me to do that?
You said:
still we have to make api call to read the each spreadsheet of the member assets profile weekly. how can we minimize this ? also how can i use BigQuery for long term solutions , then we don't need to use google sheet? But we will need to use the google sheet also
ChatGPT said:

Great questions — this is exactly where you can massively cut down workload and API calls by restructuring how the data is stored and synced. Let me break it down clearly for both short-term and long-term so you avoid unnecessary API reads and still stay compatible with Google Sheets.
✅ PROBLEM: Right now, you'd have to read 1,000+ individual sheets every week

That means:

    1,000+ API calls just to read portfolios

    Slow, error-prone, costs time & quota

    Gets worse with 5k, 10k, 30k users

We need a smarter structure so you don’t have to “loop through 1,000 files” every week.
✅ SHORT-TERM (0–1000 members): Keep Google Sheets, but add a Master Sync Sheet

Instead of reading each user's Google Sheet every week, we can:
🔹 1. Create a “MASTER PORTFOLIO SHEET”

Columns like:

MemberID | Email | Asset | Type | SourceSheetURL | LastSynced

🔹 2. Sync only when changes happen (NOT weekly)

Use Apps Script triggers so that when a member or consultant modifies their sheet:

    The updated rows are pushed to the Master Sheet

    No need to read all sheets every week

✅ Now your weekly job reads only ONE sheet, not 1000.
📌 Weekly Newsletter Flow:

ResearchSheet + MasterPortfolioSheet → Match assets → Build content → Send via HubSpot

✅ LONG-TERM (30k+ members): Add BigQuery as a backend

You don't need to abandon Google Sheets completely — just stop using them as your data source every week.
✅ Architecture:

Google Sheets (per user or input forms)
   ↓ (Synced automatically)
BigQuery (main data warehouse)
   → Used for matching, filtering, querying portfolios weekly

🔹 Why BigQuery solves the scaling problem:

    No need to read 30k sheets individually

    Store all portfolio data in 1 table

    Query instantly:

    SELECT Asset, MemberID FROM Portfolio WHERE Asset IN ("BTC", "ETH", "SOL")

    Per-user matching becomes milliseconds, not minutes

🔹 How Google Sheets stay in the loop:

You have 2 sync options:

✅ Option A: Periodic Sync (Nightly/Hourly)

    Apps Script pushes data from individual sheets → BigQuery table

    Members keep using their sheets as normal

✅ Option B: Connected Sheets (Live-Sync)

    Google Sheets → BigQuery directly (if using Workspace Business/Enterprise)

    Each user's sheet is just a frontend view

✅ Weekly Newsletter Automation (Long-term)

Here’s how everything flows once BigQuery is in place:
1. Research updates sheet syncs to BigQuery

Table: ResearchUpdates
Columns: Asset | WeekDate | Summary

2. Member portfolios also stored in BigQuery

Table: MemberPortfolio
Columns: MemberID | Email | Asset

3. Query all matches in one shot:

SELECT m.MemberID, m.Email, m.Asset, r.Summary
FROM MemberPortfolio m
JOIN ResearchUpdates r
ON m.Asset = r.Asset
WHERE r.WeekDate = '2025-10-27'

✅ No loops
✅ No per-file reads
✅ No 30k API calls
✅ Output is ready for newsletter generation
✅ Email Sending Efficiency (HubSpot / Amazon Pinpoint)

Doesn’t matter which service you use — you now send emails like this:

    Batch process 500–2,000 users per run

    Each message generated from matched data

    Resumable + fault-tolerant

Unsubscribe tracking is handled by the email platform (HubSpot or Pinpoint).
✅ SUMMARY
✅ Short-Term (1K users):

✔ Keep individual Google Sheets
✔ Add a Master Portfolio Sheet
✔ Use Apps Script to sync changes instead of reading all sheets weekly
✔ Run weekly personalization off the master sheet
✅ Long-Term (30K+ users):

✔ Keep Google Sheets as input UI
✔ Sync all portfolio data to BigQuery
✔ Run queries directly in BigQuery (NO per-sheet access)
✔ Generate newsletters from query results
✔ Send using HubSpot or Amazon Pinpoint

If you want, I can:
1️⃣ Draft the sync script (Sheets → Master Sheet)
2️⃣ Show how the BigQuery table should look
3️⃣ Design the newsletter-generation flow end-to-end

Just tell me which one to start with.
